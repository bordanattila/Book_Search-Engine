## Book Search Engine

## Description

This application was built around Google Books API search engine using GraphQL API and Apollo Server. The app is following the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can save books to their profile and delete them if needed. 
Building this application provided challenges and helped me to better understand how to create a MERN application.
